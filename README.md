# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

This project is a handwritten digit recognition system built using TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The model is trained on a subset of the data and can predict the digit in a given image.

# Instructions

1. Install the required Python packages (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib.
2. Run the main.py script to train the model and predict digits from test images.
3. If you want to use your own test images, add them to the digits/ folder and update the file names in the main.py script accordingly.
4. The handwrittenmodel.h5 file, which is the trained model can be viewed after you save the the on running the code.
